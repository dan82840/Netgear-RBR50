We recommend that you disable the WiFi function on your existing gateway, if it has WiFi functionality. With this mode, you can connect wired devices to the gateway and connect wired and WiFi devices to your new Orbi router. In this mode, by default, your new Orbi router's IP address is assigned by your gateway dynamically and is unlikely to be 192.168.1.1. However, you can still use the URL <a href='http://orbilogin.com' target='_blank'>http://orbilogin.com</a>to access the router's management GUI from a device connected to the router. Some <a href='BRS_orbi_router_function.html' target='_blank'>router functions</a> are not available in this mode, and you must use router mode if you want to use those functions.");</script></p>

To take full advantage of these router's advanced funcstions, we recommend that you use router mode. In router mode, the only device that can be connetcted to your existing gateway is your new Orbi router. You must connect all of your devices to the new Orbi router.
